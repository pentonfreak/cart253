1. flyflyfly version (Instead of controling the frog, we control the fly to avoid the frog's tongue, the frog will shoot his tongue faster as the game continues).
2. Fly Invasion (There will be kamikaze flies and support flies, we control the frog to dodge the kamikaze flies meanwhile we have to aim for the support flies to accumulate points).
3. Good fly Bad fly (Good flies are colored white with black stroke and when the frog catch it, we gain points and bad flies are colored black, we'll lose point if the frog eat it)
4. Sneaky Frog (The frog will hide itself underwater, to gain point, the frog has to come out of the water fast to catch flies but if the frog is too slow, the fly will run away)
5. Fly Invasion V2 (Just like the good old space invasion)
6. Vegan Frog (The frog likes to eat leaves that fall from somewhere, he has to catch the leaves to gain point, if he catches the flies, he will lose point)
7. Hallucinated Frog (The frog is hallucinated, he needs to escape to the reality, there will be 4 types of fly: R, G, B and RGB, just like frogfrogfrog just eat all the flies, but the catch is the RGB frog is big and super fast, if the frog catches the RGB fly, he'll return to reality and win)
8. Weak tummy Frog (The frog has to eat a certain of flies to stay nourished, but if he eats to much, he will vomit and vomit = lose)
9. Dave the Frog and the Giant frog (Us, as players, control Dave the Frog to defeat the Giant frog by shoot flies at him =DD)
10. Froogy Rhythm (Flies appear in sync with music beats, and the frog must catch them in rhythm for bonus points.)
11. Frog vs. Weather(Changing weather (rain, wind, fog) affects visibility and fly movement, making catching flies more challenging)
