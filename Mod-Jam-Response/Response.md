In the end Mod Jam assignment, my class looked like an arcade where I can try playing this one game but made by many different developers. This allowed me to see how each person expressed their creativity and design choices in unique ways. As I explored Philippe’s, Yelena’s, and Yvonne’s games, I noticed how personality and style shaped the experience, making each frog world feel distinct and memorable.

First, for Phillipe, the main menu is compact and cool in a quirky way. The name of the game, the instructions, and the controls for the frog are all clearly presented and organized to fit the screen. The eyes that follow the mouse are very smooth; they make me curious about the frog’s visual design. The control with arrow keys to move the frog and spacebar to shoot out its tongue makes the game unique. I initially thought the game would be easy, but the longer I played, the more chaotic it became, to the point where I couldn’t control the growing population of flies. It almost feels like the flies are Tyranids trying to swarm the world (Warhammer 40k reference).

As for Yelena, I really like the low-pixelated horseflies; they bring their own uniqueness to the game. The audio adds depth, and there are a lot of meme sound effects. A surprising element is that when I accidentally ate 2 horseflies, a meme GIF shows up. The addition of two little frogs and a background give the game a sort of story. All these aspects make the game enjoyable and bring some laughter to new players. The main menu is full of information about the game, yet it is all compact to fit into the canvas. What surprised me most was the way to start the game; it also brings something new and special. Using the mouse’s X-axis to control the frog and pressing the left mouse button to shoot its tongue is a simple and easy way to play, especially since hitting the flies is difficult. The more I gain points, the bigger the frog and two little frogs cheered me up really motivated me to eat more flies. What is going to happen if the frog becomes so big that it fills the whole screen?

Finally, for Yvonne, the frog’s visual style is very interesting; it isn’t made with simple shapes but with an actual image of a frog. The changing background with stars makes me wonder if this frog is trying to have a midnight snack. Compared to the other two game developers, this one added background music, and the lyrics are hilarious, though the volume is too loud. I would recommend lowering the BGM volume. There aren’t many special interactions besides the ever-changing background, but what caught my attention was the new flight path of the black fly. This game taught me how to manage points and believe that there is always a second chance if I catch it.

Overall, each developer brought their own essence to their game, showing how even a simple concept can be transformed through creativity. Phillipe’s chaotic swarm of flies, Yelena’s quirky sense of humor, and Yvonne’s atmospheric visuals all demonstrate different strengths and ideas. These unique aspects make each version unique, and together, they show how diverse and imaginative game design can be.
