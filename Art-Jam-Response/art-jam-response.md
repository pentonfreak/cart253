During my recent stay in my home country, I had the opportunity to spend some time exploring three digital artworks created by my classmates. Each of these works offered a unique interpretation of the same assignment, showcasing how creativity, technical skill, and personal expression can come together in distinct ways. I was genuinely impressed by how these three “artists” approached the challenge differently; transforming simple visual ideas into expressive, interactive, and deeply personal experiences. 

The first piece, created by Arielle, immediately stood out for its simplicity and charm. Her artwork welcomes the viewer with a calm and warm atmosphere, expressed through a cute, minimalist design style. The interaction between the mouse’s movement (mouseX and mouseY) and the soup bowl is smooth and consistent, making the piece feel alive and responsive. What impressed me most, however, was her decision to make the smoke loop seamlessly, creating an illusion of warmth and comfort on the digital canvas. But I am more impressed by how the mouse clicked interacts with the sound effect with it, creating a somewhat playful vibe. From Arielle’s artwork, I need to learn how to not overthink with some complex way to do things like her codes and her idea. 

Second, Aydan’s artwork is a cartoony piece, I loved how the creator gave me another approach to this assignment.  The artwork leans into dynamic elements and layers of visuals that build texture as you interact. I found the use of sound and repetition particularly compelling loops and small sonic accents that lock with visual pulses made the piece feel alive. I am astonished that there are interactions: mouse control on the bee and the kid turns red when the bee overlaps him. Aydan’s approach demonstrated that interactivity can be both entertaining and expressive, serving as a bridge between the viewer’s actions and the artwork’s emotional response. 

Benjamin’s artwork took yet another direction: conceptual and evocative. His design featured a blocky self-portrait with a cylindrical neck, at first glance appearing simple and static. However, as the viewer interacts, subtle movements, such as shifting pupils, reveal an underlying personality. The moment the head is removed, the piece suddenly evokes associations with the popular game Among Us, transforming the work into a commentary on identity and mortality. The way the background gradually darkens as the head moves further away intensifies this connection, symbolizing the descent into “death” or disappearance. Benjamin’s choice to focus on mood and concept rather than technical complexity resulted in a thought-provoking and memorable piece. 

The surprises were often technical-but-human: little touches that communicate care. For example, projects that respond to idle time by slowing motion or changing color speak to an awareness of the viewer's presence. Pieces that layer sound sparingly, so audio punctuates rather than overwhelms, demonstrate restraint and taste. Even seemingly simple code patterns; modular functions for drawing, clear separation of state and rendering, or lightweight asset loading; contributed to smoother, more polished experiences. 

Ultimately, these projects reminded me that interactivity itself is a form of storytelling. When art, code, and sound are treated as equally important elements, even the simplest sketches can become immersive, meaningful experiences. Through Arielle’s warmth, Aydan’s playfulness, and Benjamin’s conceptual depth, I was reminded that creativity in digital art lies not just in what we make, but in how we invite others to feel and interact with it.
