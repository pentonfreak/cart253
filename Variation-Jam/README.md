## Description
Hello players,

Welcome the Frog Game, ribbit!!

All these 3 games will be started if you hit the sun in the middle of the screen

1. FrogFrogFrog (Base Game)
As Froggy, you just need to eat as many flies as possible, but you only have one minute.

2. CrossFrogCross (2nd Variation)
Froggy wants to do a challenge, so he tries to eat a fly then cross the river and vice versa!

3. FrogDietFrog (3rd Variation)
It seems like Froggy has been eating too much, so help him will ya?

From the base game FrogFrogFrog, I have developed 2 more variation for it. The first one, CrossFrogCross, just like the base game but when you caught a fly, Froggy cross the river and to get back, just try to eat a fly again. For the second one, FrogDietFrog, same as the base game but there will be two flies, the black one will give you one point and the red one give deduct one point, there will be limitation to the point if you want to make Froggy healthy (at 5 points), more than at or lesser than than will result in fatty or skinny Froggy.
