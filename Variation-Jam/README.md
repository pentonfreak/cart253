## Description

From the base game FrogFrogFrog, I have developed 2 more variation for it. The first one, CrossFrogCross, just like the base game but when you caught a fly, Froggy cross the river and to get back, just try to eat a fly again. For the second one, FrogDietFrog, same as the base game but there will be two flies, the black one will give you one point and the red one give deduct one point, there will be limitation to the point if you want to make Froggy healthy (at 5 points), more than at or lesser than than will result in fatty or skinny Froggy.
