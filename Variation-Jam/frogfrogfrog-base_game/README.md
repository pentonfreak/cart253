## Description

For me, this is the frogfrogfrog game of Mr. Pippin Bar that I have modded will be the base game for the Variation Jam.
Where the frog eats flies.
In 1 minute, the frog has to eats as many flies it could.
In the beginning, you will see a start screen with the flashing "Click to start" and the instruction below it. But, to start, you have to slurp the sun first.
When began, you will see the moving clouds and the "ground". The fly is actually flies in to sine wave pattern but, by adding the SFX and narrowing down the perimeter, it looks like the flies is really buzzin'. Then, when you clicked the mouse, the frog will shoot out its tongue and make a sound.
So in 1 minute, try to eat a whole bunch!! GLHF!!!
